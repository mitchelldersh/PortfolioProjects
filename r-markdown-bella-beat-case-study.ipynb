    "## Reccomendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we know coorelation does not imply causation, we can deduce that there was a noticeable trend identified where more steps throughout the day, coorelated with longer periods of sleep. Marketing could take this info and turn it into an ad campaign where tracking step increases will hopefully improve your sleep and overall wellness.\n"
